This is just a Monero (XMR) miner


## Getting Started


`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-monero-miner.git`
 `cd go-monero-miner`
 
To build the miner, run:

go build -o monero-miner .

This will create an executable file named monero-miner. To start mining, simply run:

./monero-miner --address YOUR_MONERO_ADDRESS --pool MINING_POOL_URL

Replace YOUR_MONERO_ADDRESS with your actual Monero address, and MINING_POOL_URL with the URL of the mining pool you wish to join. For example:

./monero-miner --address 4AkjdfLKsjdflksdjf3290u4wEHUWnfdslknASDFLKJ --pool strat
